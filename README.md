# Adinkra Fonts

The Adinkra symbols are bits of wisdom embedded in icons. The oldest surviving instance of adinkra was created in 1817.

With Adinkra Fonts, you can how add these relics to your website the same way you would add icons and emojis.

## Installing

Adding the Adinkra fonts to your project is as simple as adding the CSS file to your HTML

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="adinkra.css" />
```

## Using

To use these, add the symbols with `<i />` tags

```html
    <i class="adk adk-<name>"></i>
```

> Replace <name> with the name of the adinkra symbol you want to use; e.g. adinkrahene

## Contributing

Help make Adinkra more accessible!

The roadmap I am working with is below. You may choose to contribute to this. Create issues generously, so I know if you're working on any contributions.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Release an NPM package, for easier access for frontend developers
- [ ] Add a preview component to the site; with larger symbols and their meanings
